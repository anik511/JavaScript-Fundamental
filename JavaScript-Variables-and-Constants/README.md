### JavaScript Variables and Constants

## Variables 

>A variable serves as a storage container for holding data. For instance,
```js
let x = 5;
```
>Here, x is a variable. It's storing 5.

In JavaScript, we use keyword ***var*** or ***let*** for declaring variables. Example,
```js
let a;
var b;
```
Here, a and b are variables.

## Var

- var variables are function scoped.

**What does this mean?**

>It means they are only available inside the function they're created in, or if not created inside a function, they are globally scoped.
